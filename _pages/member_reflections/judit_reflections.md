<h1>Judit üå∫</h1>
<hr class="separator">

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>The past few months and the five workshops that we have created gave me lots of insight I haven't known before about co-creation processes in general and about facilitating itself. </small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>The first reflection I had was that all creative co-creation processes need a designated facilitator for success. Whenever we held workshops, a designated person, called a facilitator would not take part in the co-creation process, but instead would observe and pitch in with guidance whenever needed, to nudge different streams of thought in the right direction. It may seem evident that a facilitator is needed for these processes, but I especially reflected on this outside of the workshops, when our team tried to create an agenda together for upcoming workshops.</small></p> 

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>All group members had their own ideas and wanted to get them to life, but in a team of five people it is nearly impossible to do this without a designated person that takes the leader role and "sits back to observe", compromising their input for the group's efficient output. This role is what I began to associate with a facilitator in a workshop sphere, and realised that it is crucial for all creation processes to have a designated person to fit this role. In my observation, during the creation of workshops this was always the upcoming workshop's facilitator taking the role.</small></p> 

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>On another note, I had several reflections about facilitating - as a process in itself. Most of these reflections are part of this website, as I believe all our team members had refletions of their own, but it is crucial that I highlight more aspects that don't necessairly fit a professional tone.</small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>When using a method, where you as a facilitator have to point to one participant to start, it is hard to find a person - in my case it nearly ended up being the same person every time. But here are a few tricks I'd like myself to remember next time I 'm facilitating: whoever takes eye contact at first, you can say "who lives the furthest away from here", or you can simply walk up to a person before you start the activity and ask "are you comfortable starting the next task?".</small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Another one is knowing when the participants need more explanation of a task, versus when you are just looking plain stupid explaining for 5 minutes straight. The line between the two is hard to draw. But in my experience, there is no such thing as "explaining too much", you should explain as much as you can, maybe even three times, and then double-check whether all participants know what to do. Don't just jump into tasks, as this could hijack your workshop results.</small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>The last thing I'd like to include on this list is knowing what to do while your participants are performing an individual task. Do you stand in one place? Do you sit down? Do you go up to each of them? The struggle is real. Next time I am facilitating a workshop and get into this situation, I would walk around the room, if the space allows, and silently look at each participant's work from a respectable distance, where they are aware of my presence but it is not disturbing their work. This way, if they have questions, they can always ask me without having to shout to the other end of the room, or raising too much attention.</small></p>

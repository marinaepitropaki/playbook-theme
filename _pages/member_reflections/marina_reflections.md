<p class="content-paragraph"><small>The workshop and facilitating experience transformed for me after this course. In our team, we faced challenges, but we also 
had moments of success. During the course, we got split into groups, and the following week, two new members joined us. I got the 
chance to be the first facilitator in our initial workshop. Our aim was to understand our potential customers better. This excited 
me because, being an empath myself, I wanted to guide the group to empathize even a little bit with people with disabilities. I 
used various methods like Persona, Desk research, and Spider web to achieve this. The feedback we got was generally positive, but, 
of course, there were areas to improve; after all, it was our first workshop (for example, participants liked the activities, but 
some were uncertain about the workshop's goal).</small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Another challenge we sometimes had to deal with was finding common hours to work outside of class hours. This led to some group 
members working more than others for a workshop, but the positive aspect was that we were rotating, so, in the end, everyone contributed 
equally. We always made sure to have an extra meeting some days before the upcoming workshop to talk about anything we were missing or 
just to align. In that context, the most challenging workshops for me were the 2nd and third, where we had to develop a board game. It was 
there where, as much as I wanted to participate, I couldn't be involved in the game creation process due to the lack of common hours with 
the rest of the group. As a workaround, I was responsible for the independent tasks, like ice-breaking or energizers. After the 2nd workshop, 
we made sure to divide tasks so that everyone would participate in the creation process independently, and at the end, we would have our 
weekly meeting to align.</small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Another aspect that I found challenging was related to the provision of equipment. Following feedback from our first workshop, it was 
suggested that we include snacks and coffee. While I am grateful for the supplies such as post-its, markers, and pens, I must express 
a concern about the additional expenses we incurred for snacks and other tools like playdoh. It would have been appreciated if these 
items were also included in the provided resources.</small>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Overall, I'd say our group communication was nice and pleasant. Apart from our weekly alignment meeting, I feel that everyone in my 
group is very kind and works well together. They're open to new ideas and discussing any thoughts. They are also proactive, which 
means that if someone wasn't available at a certain time, others would step in to help. I want to highlight how effective collaboration 
and open discussion within the group can lead to excellent results.</small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Regarding workshop reflections and feedback, we were always eager to hear thoughts from the group we worked with and from the course 
responsible. We discovered that by using both the course material and workshop techniques, we gained a better understanding of our audience 
and the workshop process. That's why in our workshops and reflections, we aimed to include as much lecture material as possible. Ultimately, 
we envision this playbook as a compilation of course material infused with our personal experiences.</small></p>

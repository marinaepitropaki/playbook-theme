<p class="content-paragraph"><small>When reflecting upon the five workshops that we have been developing and performing over the past 13 weeks, three main things come to mind.</small></p>  

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Firstly, I have learned how important the role of the facilitator is in a workshop. Originally, I mainly saw the facilitator as a timekeeper and organizer, who did not have that big of an impact. I have learned that the facilitator can bring so much more to a workshop. The mood and tone of the workshop is very much set by the facilitator and having a well prepared and calm facilitator creates a much better workshop experience.</small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Secondly, I have learned the importance of having the workshop participants in mind, when designing the workshop. The more you know about who is participating in a workshop, the easier it will be to plan it. You will be able to know how much time, that should be allocated for explaining the methods and problems and overall use the time more sufficiently. </small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Thirdly, I became aware of the importance of the ‚Äúless is more‚Äù concept. When planning the workshops, the group were too optimistic a few times in relation to time and the complexity of the workshop tasks. This is something that I will keep in mind for the future and make sure that the amount of methods and their complexity is well balanced. </small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Lastly when looking back, I can see how fun co-creation workshops can be. It‚Äôs a completely different way of developing and learning about new topics, that I can see much relevance in for my study in Design and Innovation. I have previously used workshops, but I believe that I now am more aware of the different elements of the workshop planning and performing and will be able to implement it in an even better way further on.</small></p>

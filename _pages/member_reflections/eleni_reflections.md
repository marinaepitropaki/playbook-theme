<p class="content-paragraph"><small>In the framework of the course Staging co-creation and creativity, I had the chance to participate and be part of the planning and implementation of five collaborative workshops. Upon self-reflection on  these workshops that were conducted the last 3 months, several thoughts emerged.</small></p> 
 
<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Firstly, Œô appreciated even more the co-creation approach in the design process and got inspired of co-creation methods that I am willing to implement in my future career as behavioral designer focusing on users needs.</small></p>
 
<p class="content-paragraph"><small>During these 5 workshops, I acquired additional skills in developing a sense of empathy towards the people we are designing for, to gain insights into what they need, how they feel and behave. </small></p>
 
<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Concerning the workshop I facilitated, I realized the substantial influence of my position. Factors such as being well-prepared, following a clear and structured schedule, and having a good vibe influenced the workshop process in a positive way.</small></p>
 
<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Moreover, the preparation of each workshop was cooperative and this decision helped each member of our group to be more aware of every workshop and obtain a better overview of the entire design process. </small></p>
 
<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Another crucial insight I gained was the importance of empathizing with participants, creating comfort, and incorporating breaks to boost creativity, resulting in a thorough and successful session. However, it's important to carefully select and test the methods used to create comfort, as we experienced inconvenience due to the selection of inappropriate music, for example, an upbeat playlist.</small></p>
<p class="content-paragraph"><small>All in all, these co-creation workshops were not only educational but also enjoyable, unveiling a different approach of learning and setting a valuable base for my future career as a behavioral designer.</small></p>

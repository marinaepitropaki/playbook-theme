## Double Diamond 
<small>The double diamond is a design process model and is developed for guiding designers through a problem-solution oriented process (lecture 1). It consists of two diamonds, that  follow the a divergent and convergent thinking structure each. These two diamonds together consist of four phases: Discover, Define, Develop and Deliver.

1. <span id="discover"></span><span style="font-size: smaller;">**Discover:** The discover phase is a divergent phase with the purpose of exploring and understanding the problem and the user involved. The phase includes research, information gathering, and insight sharing.</span><span style="display: none;">[Reference to Discover Phase](#discover)</span>
2. <span id="define"><span style="font-size: smaller;">**Define:** The define phase is a convergent phase with the purpose of synthesizing the information from the discover phase into a specific challenge. The outcome of the phase is a statement, that is framing the identified problem.</span> <span style="display: none;">[Reference to Define Phase](#define)</span>
3. <span id="develop"><span style="font-size: smaller;">**Develop:** The develop phase is a divergent phase with the purpose of exploring the opportunities for solving the challenge. It is a creative phase, where a lot of brainstorming is performed to generate as many ideas as possible.</span><span style="display: none;">[Reference to Develop Phase](#develop)</span>
4. <span id="deliver"><span style="font-size: smaller;">**Deliver:** The deliver phase is a convergent phase with the purpose of conceptualizing the chosen solution. Here prototyping is often used for developing and finalizing the solution.</span><span style="display: none;">[Reference to Deliver Phase](#deliver)</span>


##### How to apply in workshops: 
<small>There are several ways of applying the double diamond to a workshop. A workshop can be based on following the entire double diamond for one workshop, or a selected part of the diamond can be used, depending on the purpose and timeframe of the workshop. <small>

<small>When deciding which framework to use and when designing the workshop, it is important to consider what the starting point for the workshop is. Are we working within a well defined problem and do we understand our users? Are the workshop participants familiar with a design process/have tried something similar before? 
During our time performing workshops in ‚Äústaging co-creation and creativity‚Äù, we have been following the double diamond when designing our workshops. This has created a good baseline for understanding the purpose of the workshops and also ensuring the we during the entire course knew that we were on the right track. During the 13 weeks, we made observations and learning about how to use the model, which can be seen below. <small>

<small> A framework that we used for inspiration, of how to structure the individual workshop was the ‚ÄúCreate comfort, Stage discussion and Develop together‚Äù (Lecture 2). By ensuring that the workshop participants were comfortable during the workshop and felt safe, we created great results and overall a better atmosphere during the workshops.  The group did initially struggle with understanding how to create comfort and stage the discussion for the participants, so below our learnings about how to achieve this has been gathered. <small>

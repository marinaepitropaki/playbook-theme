Why Do Workshops and Co-creation? ðŸ¤”
<hr class="separator">

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Why you should want to facilitate co-creation and workshops is not only a good, but also an important question to raise in the context of creating this playbook. Because why should you? - Why can it not only be you coming up with all the ideas, being the source of creativity in any given project? See, there are several well sourced arguments to why you should consider carrying out a workshop and facilitating co-creation when doing a project. Creativity is not a skill that favors some people more than others, as some people are inclined to think (Valgeirsdottir, 2023, Lecture5). No, creativity is a basic human skill and creative contribution to a problem could therefore come from anyone (Valgeirsdottir, 2023, Lecture5). Yes, there are people who dwell within the domains of creativity more than others such as designers and architectures and they are therefore enhancing this skill, but most people no matter what their domain might be use their creative skill when faced with a problem that is new to them and that they need solve. It can happen sometimes that you are faced with a problem that you have been working on for so long, that your mind becomes fixated on the problem you are trying to solve, and you fall back on previous thought solutions (Valgeirsdottir, 2023, Lecture5). This is called Fixation, and it inhibits you from coming up with creative solutions. To solve this, you can either leave the problem for an unspecific amount of time, until you get that Aha! -moment (Valgeirsdottir, 2023, Lecture5). This is called incubation, and it is an extremely convenient human cognitive ability, however as no one can say how long you need to incubate a problem to come up with new solution it might not be your best bet to find creative solutions to your problem in a timely manner. Co-creation on the other hand can harness the creativity from multiple people at once, which can then relief that fixated sense from the individual and alleviate the mental pain and stress it might have caused. </small></p>  

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>Now that it is in place, that you should do co-creation, you should have a bit more leverage when trying to argue with your supervisor for why your team should start to co-create more, but we are not completely there. Depending on the given project you are conducting, co-creating with more than just your team can be very beneficial and the key to unlock new undiscovered territory in the solution space. Designers and other creative professions work in the realm of the Abstract Space in the Experts World and regular people work in the realm of the Concrete Space in the People World (Lee, 2008). By bringing people from the concrete space into the abstract space you start to explore the realm of collaboration. Here the role of the designers are Co-designers or facilitators, and the role of the people/user is now a co-worker/partner, which implies that the input of the user is equal to that of the designers in relation to the project (Lee, 2008). </small></p>

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>So how do you bring people from the concrete world into the abstract world, you ask? Well, you have probably already guessed it, - with workshops of course! A workshop is an ideal setup for gathering user input and co-create with them in your project. If the workshop is facilitated with care and notion to the invited user, they will often get a strong sensation of ownership to the project and be more invested in the outcome which can lead to even better results. When facilitating workshops with your team and/or outside stakeholders it is important, that they feel comfortable, and that you have assessed the environment (Valgeirsdottir, 2023, Lecture5). You want to make sure, that you have balanced the constraints in your workshop, making sure not to prime your participants that will lead to an unfavorable outcome (Valgeirsdottir, 2023, Lecture5). </small></p> 

<p class="content-paragraph"><small>So now you know why you should do workshops and facilitate co-creation, when trying to solve the next problem in your project. Harnessing the creativity from users or other stakeholders can shed some valuable light on the problem you at trying to solve expanding the solution space.</small></p> ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ¯
